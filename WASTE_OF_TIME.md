I agree with Itamar and José. no make sense.


1. José M. C. Quintas

- https://github.com/JoseQuintas
- https://github.com/JoseQuintas/sefazclass/blob/master/source/ze_sefazclass.prg
- https://github.com/JoseQuintas/harbour-core/commit/1662d538b68d0602a7d27651e0935b78fc67d090
- https://github.com/JoseQuintas/harbour-core/commit/14880a8db5daaa2f96fb9673998d05411706283e
- Works on harbour tbrowse and gtwvg

He seems to me as good "old-school" Clipper/Harbour developer.
He have provided some usefull contributions to harbour-core, but I haven't find too much.
Most of source written with spanish comments, so hard to understand. I suppose most of it exists for self-archive purposes.


2. Itamar M. Lins Jr.

- https://github.com/ItamarLins
- nothing interesting or useful on github
- mentioned on sourceforge hwgui, I don't know what level of development and contributions to the project he has(Sourceforge is so unsuitable for today's open-source development).


3. Lailton Fernando Mariano

- https://gitlab.com/lailton
- https://gitlab.com/users/lailton/contributed
- on gitlab - nothing public
- on github - didn't find him


4. Alain Aupeix

- https://github.com/JujuLand
- no repositories on github
- https://jujuland.pagesperso-orange.fr
- nothing interesting

He have published wiki `How to install Harbour on Ubuntu`, on [harbour.wiki](https://harbour.wiki/index.asp?page=PublicArticles).
Regarding the goal "Introducing language to the newbie on ubuntu linux", I think it should be written totally different.
But I appreciate hard work put on that!
