I agree with Itamar and José. no make sense.


1. José M. C. Quintas

- https://github.com/JoseQuintas
- https://github.com/JoseQuintas/sefazclass/blob/master/source/ze_sefazclass.prg
- https://github.com/JoseQuintas/harbour-core/commit/1662d538b68d0602a7d27651e0935b78fc67d090
- https://github.com/JoseQuintas/harbour-core/commit/14880a8db5daaa2f96fb9673998d05411706283e
- Works on harbour tbrowse and gtwvg

He seems to me as good "old-school" Clipper/Harbour developer.
He have provided some usefull contributions to harbour-core, but I haven't find too much.
Most of source written with spanish comments, so hard to understand. I suppose most of it exists for self-archive purposes.


2. Itamar M. Lins Jr.

- https://github.com/ItamarLins
- nothing interesting or useful on github
- mentioned on sourceforge hwgui, I don't know what level of development and contributions to the project he has(Sourceforge is so unsuitable for today's open-source development).


3. Lailton Fernando Mariano

- https://gitlab.com/lailton
- https://gitlab.com/users/lailton/contributed
- on gitlab - nothing public
- on github - didn't find him


4. Alain Aupeix

- https://github.com/JujuLand
- no repositories on github
- https://jujuland.pagesperso-orange.fr
- nothing interesting

He have published wiki `How to install Harbour on Ubuntu`, on [harbour.wiki](https://harbour.wiki/index.asp?page=PublicArticles).
Regarding the goal "Introducing language to the newbie on ubuntu linux", I think it should be written totally different.
But I appreciate hard work put on that!



Answer
===================

Hi Lailton Fernando Mariano,
I appreciate your and other's feedback.

I understand that you don't like my work. And, that is ok.
Anyway, I think it is NOT acceptable in one open-source project mark other's work and efforts as WASTE OF TIME.
My work may be not useful  to you and others. But it should be appreciated anyway.
The most important assets in open-source project are PEOPLE (with their skills) and TIME (given to the project).
Be aware, you are not my boss who gave me a salary for bad result. The way of communication in an healthy 
open-source community should be different. 
It should be allowed to say: "You are WRONG", but never: "YOUR WORK IS WASTE OF TIME"!

I have investigated about your and other participants open-source work  in this discussion:

https://github.com/hernad/harbour/blob/master/WASTE_OF_TIME.md

I consider that my and everyone else's CREDIBILITY in open-source project should be measured at first place 
through their direct CONTRIBUTIONS with source code and documentation to the project.

This community has big problem because participants spend to much time on discussions (and I suppose) 
particular closed-source projects), despite direct contributing with source code and documentation.

My decision to take substantial time to answer you as such can be a waste of time.
But that judgement is mine. You are free to read or not. You are free use it or not.
That is open-source spirit.
